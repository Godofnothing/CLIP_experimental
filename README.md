# CLIP_experimental
---
This repository contains experiments and results of comparison of image features extractors generated by classical training on ImageNet and CLIP[[paper](link.to.paper)] training procedure on a specific [Fruits](link.to.dataset) dataset.

### **Zero-shot preditions**
The procedure described in the CLIP [paper](link.to.paper) allows to make predictions on a new image dataset with any set of labels without training.
<p align="center"><img src="pics/zero-shot-visualization.jpg" width="450" /></p>

We compared features extractors with different architectures and training procedures:
1. Zero-shot of CLIP with ViT/ResNet
2. K-shot of CLIP with ViT/ResNet
3. Linear probing of CLIP with ViT/ResNet
4. Linear probing of ViT/ResNet trained on ImageNet
5. Fine-tuning of CLIP with ViT/ResNet
6. Fine-tuning of ViT/ResNet trained in ImageNet

We also compared 2 image upsampling options:
 - Bucubic interpolations
 - SRGAN upsampling

Main plots can be found in the [results](#results) section. Full experiments descriptions can be found in the ```report.pdf```
